# Sampling-Techniques

---
## Sampling1: Simple Random Sampling
Random selection of 70% of the training data without considering class distribution.

## Sampling2: Stratified Sampling
Maintains the original class distribution by sampling 70% from each class proportionally.

## Sampling3: Systematic Sampling
Selects every 2nd record from the training data in a systematic manner.

## Sampling4: Cluster Sampling
Uses KMeans clustering (10 clusters)
Randomly selects 5 clusters
Includes all samples from selected clusters

## Sampling5: Bootstrap Sampling
Random sampling with replacement, creating a sample of 70% of the original training size.
